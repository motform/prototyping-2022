/*
  A short example in which we use `fetch()` to load a local .json file.
  The same technique could be used to load any kind of local file, just make sure
  to use the correct method to get the data out of the response object.
  See: http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response for all methods.

  The example JSON is from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON

  NOTE: You will need to run this example using VS Code Live preivew because of
  browser file access policies. It will not work if ran on its own.
