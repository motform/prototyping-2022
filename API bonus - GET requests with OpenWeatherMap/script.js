/*
  This script communicates with the OpeWeatherMap API using GET requests.
  The OpenAI API we have seen before uses POST, where the inputs are sent
  in JSON as the body of the request. GET requests ignore the body, and so
  you need to modify the url parameters in order to get what you want. This
  demo is primarily an example of how you can do that in modern JS using
  the `URL` object, `URLSearchParams` and `fetch()`.

  You will have to provide your own API key for this to work,
  see the variable "openWeatherMapAPIKey". Get a key: https://openweathermap.org

// OpenWeatherMap uses GET requests, which means that we pass
// parameters as SearchParams. The eaiest way to do this is to
// make an object with the params, appending them to a URL object
// using the `URLSearchParams` constructor.
// See my demo for more details.

// `state` is just an object that we use to keep track
// of all of our application state. In this example, we
// only have one property, `reponses`, but you could image
// adding more properties to model the user interaction.
