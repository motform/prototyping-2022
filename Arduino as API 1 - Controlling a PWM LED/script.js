  This script communicates unidirectionally with an Arduino through JSON.
  It assumes the Arduino to be flashed with `pwd_led_json`, providing a PWM LED on D6.
  We talk to the Arduino async using the Web Serial API, storing the appliaction
  data in a global object called `state`.

  This script uses the Web Serial API. As of writing, this is only supported in
  chromium based web browsers. It will _not_ work in Safari or Firefox.
  See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API
